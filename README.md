# Terraform module of  AWS - S3 Basic Bucket - Just for learn purpose!!!

All terraform modules from my repositories is only for learn purpose, so it can be broken, incomplete or not working well!

So if you use that code be careful and you will be at your own!!! Good lucky!!!

# What is an S3 Bucket and your relation to Public Access Block?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

# Motivation
I wrote a lot of codes using terraform modules and for each individual project I had to replicated the modules.

Therefore as terraform accept to work with remote repositories I decided to use github as my source of terraform modules.

# About the project
This project just store the common git files (license and readme.md) and terraform files (main, var and output).
